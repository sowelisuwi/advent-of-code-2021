# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) in üê∫ [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/), also known as Mathematica.

Wishing everyone a joyful holiday season! :3

## Calendar

## Instructions

You'll need WolframScript. It comes with Mathematica or Wolfram Engine. It's all bundled with [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), if you happen to use it.
Alternatively, these packages work too (free, limited use):

- [Wolfram Engine for desktop](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/) (Linux x86-64, macOS, Windows)
- [Mathematica for Raspberry Pi](https://www.wolfram.com/raspberry-pi/)

Please note that all of this is very proprietary~

Once you have set it all up and `wolframscript -help` works, you can execute the solutions!
For example, to see the answers for day 7, run `./day_07/solution.wls`.

The first line is the answer to part 1, and the second line is the answer to part 2.
