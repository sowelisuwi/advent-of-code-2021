# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) in üê∫ [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/), also known as Mathematica.

Wishing everyone a joyful holiday season! :3

## Calendar

- [Day 1: Sonar Sweep](day_01/) ‚≠ê‚≠ê
- [Day 2: Dive!](day_02/) ‚≠ê‚≠ê
- [Day 7: The Treachery of Whales](day_07/) ‚≠ê‚≠ê

Problem descriptions are generated by [Advent of Code to Markdown](https://github.com/kfarnung/aoc-to-markdown) browser extension. Thanks, Kyle!

## Instructions

You'll need either Wolfram Engine or Mathematica. Both come bundled with [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
Or, you can download a copy for free (limited use):

- [Wolfram Engine for desktop](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/)
- [Mathematica for Raspberry Pi](https://www.wolfram.com/raspberry-pi/)

Please note that all of this is very proprietary.

Once you have set it all up and `wolframscript -help` works, you can execute the solutions! For example, to see the answers for day 7, run:

```
$ wolframscript -file day_07/solution.wls
```
